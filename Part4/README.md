    <strong>What is the vision of the Microsoft platform for containerized applications?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The vision is to create an adaptable, enterprise-grade, containerized application life cycle that spans development, IT operations, and production management.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>What are the main pillars in the life cycle of Docker applications as per the Microsoft platform?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The main pillars are app development, DevOps infrastructure processes, and IT management and operations. These areas are typically managed by different personas with varying skills.
</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>How does Microsoft ensure flexibility and openness in their containerized Docker application workflow?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft provides an open framework that allows for a flexible workflow capable of adjusting to different organizational contexts. The infrastructure components and products can be swapped out to suit future needs, supporting both Microsoft and third-party technologies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>List some of the Microsoft technologies and third-party tools that can be used in the platform for Docker apps.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft technologies: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, .NET, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Registry.
Third-party tools: Any code editor (e.g., Sublime), any language (Node.js, Java, Go), any orchestrator and scheduler, any Docker registry.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>What DevOps tools are compatible with Docker apps on the Microsoft platform?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft tools: Azure DevOps Services, Microsoft Team Foundation Server, GitHub, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Third-party tools: GitHub, Git, Subversion, Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Velocity, CircleCI, TravisCI, On-premises Docker Datacenter, Kubernetes, Mesos DC/OS.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>How can IT manage and monitor Docker applications using Microsoft tools?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>IT can use the Azure portal, which helps set up and maintain Docker environments with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Docker tools, CLI Docker tools, and PowerShell with Linux Subsystem can also be used for managing container applications. Additionally, Azure Monitor provides comprehensive monitoring for production environments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>Describe the platform for Docker app development as defined by Microsoft.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Developers use their preferred languages and editors (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Go, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code) to develop services deployed as containers. Docker containers are used to build, run, test, and debug code locally, providing the destination environment at development time. This integration with Docker significantly enhances the DevOps life cycle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>What are the components of the DevOps process for Docker apps according to Microsoft?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Developers can use Azure DevOps, GitHub, or other third-party products like Jenkins for automated application life-cycle management (ALM). This includes source-code control, Continuous Integration (CI), internal unit tests, inter-container/service integration tests, Continuous Delivery (CD), and release management (RM). Docker application releases can be automated into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>How does Azure Monitor contribute to the management and monitoring of Docker applications?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure Monitor allows for comprehensive monitoring of production Docker applications. By integrating its SDK into services, it provides system-generated log data from applications, enabling detailed monitoring and insights.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>What advantages does GitHub Advanced Security offer for containerized applications?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub Advanced Security provides tools for securing the software supply chain, integrating seamlessly into the daily workflow of teams developing containerized applications. This enhances the overall security of the development process.</li>
    </ul>
